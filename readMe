Welcome to my project ! 
Here are some useful information :
I) If you are using the interface part , you should know that there are two ways on creating the maze !
***!!!!! Please go to the package "interfaceGraphique" , then to the class "StartMyMaze" to display and run the code !!!!!****
*The first one is by clicking on "Load" button. Choose your file and remember that the following cases will give you error messages :
**Loading an empty file.
**Loading files that are not text files.
**Loading a file where you don't have the same number of boxes per line.
**Loading a file that contains a character which isn't in the following list {'E','A','D','W'}.
**Loading a file with having more than one 'A' or 'D' character.
**Loading a non-existent file.
*The second one is by clicking on "Create new maze" button.
**Choose the number of lines.
**Choose the number of columns.
**You can't put characters that are not numbers or numbers less than 1.
**You will have a maze where all the polygons are empty.
- To change the nature of a polygon there are two different ways : 
** You can simply click on the polygon , a small window would pop-up asking you to choose the label :
A for 'Arrival' , D for 'Departure', E for 'Empty' , W for 'Wall'. 
Once you select it , the polygon will turn to the chosen type.
** You can use Quick mode : Click on 'Quick mode' button.
A small window would pop-up asking you which label you want to select between 'E' and 'W'.
Once you select your label. Just click on the polygons that you want to turn into the type you've chosen.
!!!Once you finish , don't forget to click on 'End quick mode' button !!!
You won't need this mode to select your arrival and departure hexagones because you only need one for both and it doesn't require 
much time to put them.
- Once you finish preparing your maze and after putting your arrival and departure polygons , you can click on 'Solve' to find
the shortest path between these two.
- If you click on solve and the red panel on the right turns to green, it means that there is a solution and it is displayed by tied 
segments going through the centers of the polygons forming the path.
- If the red panel stays red , it means there is no solution.
- You can click on 'Unsolve' button to take off the path.
- You can save your maze by clicking on 'Save as' button. Choose where you wanna put your file and name it.
- If any changes occur , you can save them simply by clicking on 'Save' button.
- You can find some load examples and savings I've done respectively  in the loadSample folder and the saveAs folder
 in the project explorer 
 -!!! Finally when you run the code you will be asked if you want to be reminded of some of these tips.!!!
II) if you are using the first part with the files :
****!!!!! Please go to the package "maze", then to the class "MainTestWithFiles" and run the code !!!!!****
- Creating an empty maze will with n lines and c columns will be like this : Maze m = new Maze(new MazeBox[n][c]);
- When you want to initialize it with a file , the file you choose must respect the following conditions :
**It must have n lines and c columns.
**It mustn't be empty.
**It must exist to begin with.
**It must have one and only arrival and departure box.
**It must not have a character that isn't 'A' or 'D' or 'E' or 'W'.
 !!!!!!!!!! Each time you choose a new file , remember to change your maze m and adapt it to your file ( by changing n or/and c)!!!!!!!!!!
 - After creating your maze , it will be solved and put in a file you choose.
 ** If there is no solution : your file will contain the following message "Pas de solution".
 ** If there is a solution : it will be displayed by dots from the departure box to the arrival one. The dots go through the empty 
 boxes forming the path.
 - You can find some examples of mazes and their solutions or some examples of mazes with errors in the folder "data" in the project explorer.
 Thanks for you attention and I hope you like my project !
